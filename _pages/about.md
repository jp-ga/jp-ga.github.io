Hi! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Physics](https://physics.uchicago.edu/) and [Enrico Fermi Institute](https://efi.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) under the guidance of [Young-Kee Kim](https://hep.uchicago.edu/~ykkim/index.shtml) (UChicago), Ryan Roussel (Stanford) and [Auralee Edelen](https://www.leelinska.com/) (Stanford). My current research focuses on developing machine learning methods for the reconstruction of electron beam distributions in particle accelerators to study their dynamics. Our work is conducted in close collaboration with state-of-the-art particle accelerator facilities at [Argonne National Lab](https://www.anl.gov/awa) and [SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory](https://lcls.slac.stanford.edu/lcls-ii).

Outside of work, I enjoy playing various racket sports, riding my bike, running, playing the guitar and piano, and cuddling with my cat (who most likely questions my musical aptitude). Additionally, I love exploring new places, both in Colombia and around the globe. I also enjoy exploring Chicago (except during the winter, of course).
