I am a PhD student in the [Department of Physics](https://physics.uchicago.edu/) and [Enrico Fermi Institute](https://efi.uchicago.edu/) at [The University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) advised by [Young-Kee Kim](https://hep.uchicago.edu/~ykkim/index.shtml). My current research focuses on developing machine learning methods for phase space reconstruction of electron beams in particle accelerators. These high-dimensional reconstruction methods will enable better understaing of novel beam manipulation schemes and provide experimental validation of advanced beam dynamics concepts. 

Before I joined UChicago, I was a post-baccalaureate research scholar at [Cornell University](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/) under supervision of [Jared Maxson](https://physics.cornell.edu/jared-maxson). During this appointment, I assisted in the experimental design and simulation studies of an ultra-fast electron diffraction beamline.
