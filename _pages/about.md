Hi! I am a PhD Candidate in the [Department of Physics](https://physics.uchicago.edu/) and [Enrico Fermi Institute](https://efi.uchicago.edu/) at the [University of Chicago](https://www.uchicago.edu/) under the guidance of [Young-Kee Kim](https://hep.uchicago.edu/~ykkim/index.shtml) (UChicago), Ryan Roussel (Stanford) and [Auralee Edelen](https://www.leelinska.com/) (Stanford). My current research focuses on developing machine learning methods for the phase space reconstruction of electron beams in particle accelerators. These high-dimensional reconstruction methods will enable a better understanding of novel beam manipulation schemes and provide experimental validation of advanced beam dynamics concepts. Specifically, I am using these methods to study coherent synchrotron radiation effects in linear accelerators. Our work is conducted in close collaboration with the [Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility](https://www.anl.gov/awa) and [Stanford's FACET-II](https://facet-ii.slac.stanford.edu/).

Before joining UChicago, I worked as a post-baccalaureate research scholar at [Cornell University](https://www.classe.cornell.edu/) under the supervision of [Jared Maxson](https://physics.cornell.edu/jared-maxson). During this appointment, I assisted in the experimental design and simulation studies of an ultra-fast electron diffraction beamline. 

Outside of work, I enjoy playing various racket sports, riding my bike, running, playing the guitar and piano, and cuddling with my cat (who most likely questions my musical aptitude). Additionally, I love exploring new places, both in Colombia and around the globe. I also enjoy exploring Chicago (except during the winter, of course).
